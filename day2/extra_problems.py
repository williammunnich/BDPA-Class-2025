"""
Challenge 1: Detective Data Organizer
Create a program that asks the user for their detective profile 
information (name, age, experience level) and stores it in a dictionary. 
Then, print the details.
"""

"""
Challenge 2: Clue Categorizer
Ask the user for a list of clues they have found (separated by commas). 
Store these in a list and print them. Then, categorize them as "Strong Evidence" 
if they contain certain keywords (like "fingerprint" or "blood"), otherwise 
categorize them as "General Clue".
"""

"""
Challenge 3: Crime Scene Decision Maker
Using if, elif, and else statements, create a program that evaluates a suspect 
based on three pieces of evidence (e.g., presence at the scene, possession of 
stolen items, and witness reports). Print whether they are "Highly Suspicious", 
"Moderately Suspicious", or "Unrelated".
"""

"""
Challenge 4: Case Solver Simulator
Use a while loop to simulate a detective trying to guess a secret code to 
unlock a safe. The user should keep entering guesses until they match the 
correct code, which is set in the program.
"""

"""
Challenge 5: Crime Scene Visualizer
Use the matplotlib and pygame libraries to visualize a simple crime scene. 
Use matplotlib to plot the locations of clues on a graph and pygame to display 
a basic interface where the user can click on different areas of the crime scene.
