# Modular Programming: Importing Cooking Functions
Create a new file called `cooking_helpers.py`, move `boil_water()` into it, and import it here.
"""

# In cooking_helpers.py, define:
# def boil_water():
#     print("Boiling water...")

# Challenge: Uncomment the import below after creating cooking_helpers.py
# from cooking_helpers import boil_water
# boil_water()
